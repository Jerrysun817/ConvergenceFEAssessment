# ConvergenceFEAssessment

## Features
- Self implemented Carousel
- Loading Screen when reordering photos
- Clear the localStorage when "r" is pressed
- Button to navigate throught the photos
- Transition animation for scrolling smoothly

## Other Implementations In Other Branch
- Using react-responsive-carousel
- Will work better with a smaller size photo array
Problems faced:
- Border is unavailable for this implementation
- Cannot use 'showThumbs' or 'showIndicators' since the size of photos is too large
